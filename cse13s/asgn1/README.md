# Assginment 1 - Getting Acquinted with Unix and C

### How to build

The user must run chmod +x plot.sh in order to set the executable bit of plot.sh

### How to run

To use plot.sh, ensure that the files plot.sh, collatz.c and Makefile are all in the same directory. Then, use the command ./plot.sh to run the script. The user does not need to input any values or variables for the script to run other than the command to run it. 

### file descriptions

plot.sh: This bash script produces the Collatz sequences of four different plots. The plots being a collatz sequence lengths graph, a maximum collatz sequence value graph, a collatz sequence length histogram, and a collatz sequence total sum graph.

collatz.c: This file contains the implementation of the Collatz sequence program which returns a collatz sequence.

DESIGN.pdf: describes the plot.sh design and design process. 

WRITEUP.pdf: displays the final pdf outputs of the plot.sh bash script and includes discussions on which UNIX commands were used to produce each plot.   

Makefile: This file directs the compilation process of the Collatz sequence program.
